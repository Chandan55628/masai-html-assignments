  <p>Hi, I'm Chandan Singh, an aspiring full-stack web developer learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am passionate about building websites and web applications.</p>

  <h3>What I'm Learning</h3>
  <p>Currently, I am learning the basics of HTML, which includes elements like headings, paragraphs, and links. This helps me build the structure of web pages.</p>

  <h4>My Favorite Resource</h4>
  <p>I often refer to 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a> 
    for clear and detailed explanations about HTML and other web technologies.
